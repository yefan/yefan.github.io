We won the 2021 [Retail Digital Transformation Grand Challenge](https://beyondstandards.ieee.org/2021-retail-digital-transformation-grand-challenge-winners/#:~:text=DevelopmentTechnologyVideos-,Universidad%20Rey%20Juan%20Carlos%2C%20University%20of%20Florence%2C%20and%20Vital%20Mechanics,Retail%20Digital%20Transformation%20Grand%20Challenge). It's a moment to celebrate!

Before I start the journey of developing simulation software for the apparel industry, I had no idea what a polluting industry it is below the surface. According to [UNECE](https://unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/RCM_Website/RFSD_2018_Side_event_sustainable_fashion.pdf), it's the second highest user of water worldwide, producing 20 percent of global water waste. More shockingly, 85 percent of textiles are sent to landfills. 

I don't consider myself particularly sentimental to the environmental issues, there's just too much, but I still feel pretty sad watching people throwing away completely fine garments and not being conscious of any of the environmental impacts. I guess that might be the norm in such a high consuming society as we live in right now. 

Technology can definitely play a role for remediating technical issues such as optimizing the fit, picking the right size, etc. But I think all the mess we got ourselves into is from the never ending need of consuming more. It's a long way to go, but we'll do our part.
